# Mongo API Project

The project was about seeding a json file to MongoDB and use Mongoose models to
fetch data from the database.

## The problem

I used MongoDB for the database and mongoose in building the api endpoints.

## The endpoints

Documentation of endpoints can be found in file _Documentation.md_
